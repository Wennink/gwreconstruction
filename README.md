This program is associated with the paper 'Reconstruction theorems for genus 2
Gromov-Witten invariants' by Thomas Wennink.

This program contains an old version of admcycles. See https://gitlab.com/modulispaces/admcycles

An improved version of part of this has been incorporated into the admcycles project.

To install the program place the admcycles and thesiscode folders in the same directory. Then run sagemath from that directory and type load('reconstructioncode/init.sage')

There is a list of functions in the file "papercommands.sage" that provide the data required in the paper.

When there are partially symmetric relations, our convention is that the first points are fixed by the symmetry action, while the later points are the 'unsymmetric' ones
